# CQTKit
A fast implementation of the Constant Q Transform on top of the Accelerate framework.

## Usage

Either include the Xcode project as a sub-project and add the framework target as a dependency, or just drop in the CQT.hpp/.cpp source files into your project and link against the Accelerate framework.
